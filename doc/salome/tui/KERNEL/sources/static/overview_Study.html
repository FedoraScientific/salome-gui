<h2><a name="1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>In SALOME application the Study module is used for management (creation, saving 
  etc.) of studies. In the framework of the platform, a study represents a working 
  document allowing to manage the data produced by various components which are 
  integarted into SALOME.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="2"></a>2. Representation of the study</h2>
<p>The study represents a set of objects that we will call Study Objects or SObjects. 
  The study can be represented as a tree, every node of that tree containing a 
  SObject. SObjects in the study can be values or references towards data of calculation, 
  graphs of calculation, trees of construction of detail(room), results. Every 
  SOject of the study is characterised by a unique identifier in the study.</p>
<p>The study allows to describe the following relations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The link between the transient and persistent values of an SObject.</li>
  <li>The relations between the SObjects produced by different components.</li>
  <li>The relations between the SObjects produced by the same component.</li>
  <li>The link between an object and its user name.</li>
  <li>The access to the definition of the component which produce an object of 
    the study.</li>
  <li>The access to instance of the component (if this one exists) which has produced 
    this SObject of the study.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every SObject in the study contains a set of attributes. These attributes represent 
  a set of definitions associated to that object, they can contain values or corba 
  references towards the data contained in the internal data structure of a component.</p>
<p>As the structure of the study is tree-like it is possible to associate sub-objects 
  to objects.</p>
<p>As particular object, the study contains Component Data which are labels associated to the component
which produce data in the study. It is to this object that we can associate attributes containing ID which
we shall allow to identify the type of the component and also its instance. Objects produced by a
component will be sub-objects of the coresponding Data Component.</p>
<p>For example Component Data GEOM will contain the data produced by the component 
  Geom.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Study_Struct.gif"></td>
    <td>GEOM contains the data produced by the component GEOM. The component MESH 
      contains a SObject Mesh_1 wich refers to the SObject identified 
      by ID4 corresponding to Geometrie_1.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>We distinguish two forms of the study, the study opened in a session SALOME and the study in the
persistent format. These two formats are described in the following sections</p>
<h3><a name="2_1"></a>2.1 Study in transient format</h3>
<p>The representation of the study in memory will be based on the document OCAF (supplied by OCC).
The document OCAF can be seen as a tree, every node of that tree is identified by <i>a tag</i> representing an integer value.</p>
<p>The exploration of the tree from the root to a node supplies a sequence of tags which establishes a
unique identifier <i>ID</i>. ID represents a character string containing the sequence of tags separated by
one ':'.</p> 
<p>For example  0:1:12:4 </p>
<p>To every node we can associate a set of attributes.</p>
<p>The attributes which the study can contain can be of the following types:</p>
<ul>
<li>All standard attributes supplied by OCC (package TdataStd) which allow to define (integers,
real, strings, identifiers, references etc.)</li>
<li>Attributes which contain CORBA references.</li>
<li>Attributes which contain the path HDF to reach the persistent datum. (Cf. the following chapter)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Remark</b>: it is the study which takes care to build the attributes from the values which are passed to it, so
an attribute is always in a study, and it knows the study object to which it is attached.</p>
<p>Example of a Study Object as a set of various attributes.</p>
<img src="SObject.gif"> 
<h3><a name="2_2"></a>2.2 Study in persistent format</h3>
<p>To store a study HDF format is used, this tool allows to represent persistent data in the form of a tree.</p>
<p>Under the root of the persistent document, you can find a set of nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first node contains the skeleton of the study. The skeleton consists of the identifiers of the
objects, as well as the references among them.</li>
<li>There is also one node for every component which has produced data during this SALOME session. Under each of these
node there are values of the data produced by this component.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="2_3"></a>2.3 Link between transient and persistent formats</h3>
<p>It will be possible to complete the definition of one object in the study by associating to it an attribute
<i>HDFPath</i> which will contain the path to the persistent data.</p>

<h2><a name="3"></a>3. Services and features of the study</h2>
<p>The Study in SALOME application possess a wide functionality. This functionality is provided by a set of classes which are described
below.
<h3><a name="3_1"></a>3.1 Study class</h3>
<p>The purpose of the Study class is to manage the data produced by various components 
  of SALOME platform. Most of the Study operations are handled by the <a href="#3_3">StudyManager</a> 
  and the <a href="#3_2">StudyBuilder</a>. What 
  is left in the Study class are elementary inquiries. A Study is explored by 
  a set of tools, mainly iterators , which are described further.</p> 
  <p>Nevertheless, the Study class contains a set of methods providing: </p>
  
<ul>
  <li>management of study properties 
  <li> search for SObjects. 
  <li>search for SComponents
  <li>creation of a new StudyBuilder, ComponentIterator, ChildIterator etc.
</ul>
<p>The API reference for this class can be found <a href="interfaceSALOMEDS_1_1Study.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="3_2"></a>3.2 StudyBuilder class</h3>
<p>StudyBuilder supplies basic services to edit the study. The edition of the study is made by the
component. Every component will use the basic services of the StudyBuilder allowing to write and publish objects.</p>
<p>StudyBulder provides the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
  <li>creation, modification or deletetion of SObjects in the study</li>
  <li>creation or removal of SComponents </li>
  <li>undo/redo functionality. For that purpose it supplies the methods NewCommand, 
    CommitCommand, AbortCommand. </li>
</ul>
<p>The API reference for this class can be found <a href="interfaceSALOMEDS_1_1StudyBuilder.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="3_3"></a>3.3 StudyManager class</h3>
<p>The purpose of the Manager is to manipulate Studies. Since SALOME is a multi-document 
  application during a working session you can operate as many stadies as you 
  wishes to create. </p>
<p>For that purpose StudyManager provides the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
  <li>creation, opening, closing and saving studies</li>
  <li>navigation through a set of studies present in the current working session</li>
  <li> copy/paste of the objects in the study functionality.</li>
