<h2>Operations</h2>

The functionalities of VTK viewer are available via its Viewer
Toolbar. Buttons marked with small downward triangles have extended
functionality which can be accessed by locking on them with left mouse
button.

<hr>

\image html vtk_view_camera_dump.png

<b>Dump View</b> - exports an object from the viewer in bmp, png or
jpeg image format.
<hr>

\image html vtk_view_style_switch.png

<b>Interaction style switch</b> - allows to switch between standard
and "keyboard free" interaction styles. "Keyboard free" style allows
to process all view transformations without using keyboard (only by
mouse) and perform selection in view by pressing "S" key. By default,
rotation in this mode is performed by left mouse button, panning - by
middle mouse button, zooming - by left and middle mouse buttons
pressed simultaneously.
<hr>

\image html vtk_view_zooming_style_switch.png

<b>Zooming style switch</b> - allows to switch between standard
(zooming at the center of the view) and advanced (zooming at the
current cursor position) zooming styles. The second mode is available
only for parallel (non-perspective) view's mode.
<hr>

\image html vtk_view_highlight.png

<b>Dynamic pre-selection switch</b> - allows to switch on/off dynamic
pre-selection of objects. When the dynamic pre-selection is switched
on, an objects can be selected by clicking the point/cell belonging to
this object, with some performance loss. Switch dynamic pre-selection
off to have a good performance on big objects (for example, huge
meshes).
<hr>

\image html vtk_view_triedre.png

<hr>

\image html vtk_view_zoom.png

<b>Zoom</b> - allows to zoom in and out.
<hr>

\image html vtk_view_pan.png

By default the rotation point is located in the Center of the bounding
box of an object.

Unchecking <b>Use Bounding Box Center</b> checkbox allows you to
define the coordinates of the rotation point manually.

- <b>Set to Origin</b> button restores the default rotation point
  coordinates.

- <b>Select Point from View</b> button allows to select the rotation
  point in the 3D Viewer.

<hr>

\image html vtk_view_rotate.png

<b>Rotation</b> - allows to rotate the selected object using the
mouse.

These buttons orientate the scene strictly about coordinate axes:
\b Front, \b Back, \b Top, \b Bottom, \b Left or \b Right side.
<hr>

\image html vtk_view_anticlockwise.png

<b>Rotate counterclockwise</b> - rotates view 90° counterclockwise.
<hr>

\image html vtk_view_clockwise.png

<b>Rotate clockwise</b> - rotates view 90° clockwise.
<hr>

\image html vtk_view_reset.png

<b>Reset</b> - restores the default position (isometric) of objects in
the scene.
<hr>

\image html vtk_view_update_rate.png

<b>Update Rate</b> - allows to define the Update Rate for the
presentations displayed in the viewer.

\image html updaterate.png

- <b>Desired Update Rate, FPS</b> - allows to set the target Update
  Rate  

- <b>Still Update Rate, FPS</b> - allows to set the Update Rate for
  the periods when both the user and the application do not perform
  any actions in the viewer

- <b>Current Update Rate, FPS</b> - shows the Update Rate currently
  available on your configuration 

- <b>Number of Cells</b> - shows the number of cells currently in
  display 

<hr>

\image html vtk_view_scaling.png

<b>Scaling</b> - represents objects deformed (stretched or stuffed)
along the axes of coordinates.
<hr>

\image html vtk_view_graduated_axes.png

<b>Graduated axes</b> - allows to define parameters of axes and
graduate them.

\image html graduatedaxes1.png

- <b>Axis name</b> - if checked the axis name is displayed in the viewer.

  - <b>Name</b> - allows to redefine the name of the axis.

  - <b>Font</b> - allows to define color and properties of the font of axis name.

- <b>Labels</b> - if checked the labels are displayed in the viewer.<

  - <b>Number</b> - allows to define the number of labels.

  - <b>Offset</b> - allows to define the distance between labels.

  - <b>Font</b> - allows to define color and properties of the font of labels names.

- <b>Tick marks</b> - if checked the tick marks are displayed in the viewer.

\image html vtk_view_parameters.png

<b>Change View Parameters</b> - this button provides access to the
dialog box allowing customization different parameters of the view.

  projection mode

- <b>Focal Point</b> - allows to specify the focal point of the view

  - <b>Set to Bounding Box Center</b> - chooses the center of the
    bounding box of the current scene as the focal point.

  - <b>Set to Origin</b> - chooses the global coordinates system origin as
    the focal point

  - <b>Select Point from View</b> - allows to specify the focal point by the
    direct selection of a point in the view window

  - <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>Z</b> - allows to input the coordinates of the focal
    point directly

  - <b>View Up Direction</b> - direction of the "view up" vector.

  mode</b> only)

- <b>View Angle</b> - the current view angle (available in the <b>Perspective
  mode</b> only)

<hr>

\image html vtk_view_sync.png

<b>Synchronize view</b> - allows to synchronize 3d view
parameters. This button has two states - checked and
unchecked. Clicking on this button opens a drop-down menu listing the
compatible 3d views. As soon as the user selects any view from the
list, the parameters (view point, position, zoom coefficient, etc.) of
the current view are synchronized with the selected view (static
synchronization).

In addition, when this button is in the "checked" state, the dynamic
synchronization of the views is performed, i.e. any zoom, pan, rotate
or other view operation done in one view is automatically applied to
the other view.
<hr>

\image html vtk_view_parallel.png

<b>Orthogonal mode</b> - Switches the view to the orthogonal mode.
