\page setting_preferences_page Setting Preferences

All user preferences of \b SALOME application can be customized using the
common \b Preferences dialog box. This dialog can be open using the
<b><i>File > Preferences...</i></b> menu item.

The \b Preferences dialog box consists of two parts:
- Available preferences sections are listed in the left part of the dialog
box; usually this list contains "SALOME" item that specifies general
application preferences and a separate section for each SALOME module
available in the current session.
- The tabbed widget at the right side of the dialog box provides
controls that can be used to customize the preferences.

\note The preferences for modules become accessible only after
explicit loading of these modules. Until then the dialog box will
show the corresponding warning message. 

More detailed information about preferences for certain modules can be found in the User's guide of the corresponding module.

General application preferences are specified in the \b SALOME section
of the \b Preferences dialog box. These preferences affect on the
application look-n-feel and common functionality.

If the study has just been started and other
modules have not been loaded yet, it will be possible to change only the settings which refer to
the whole GUI SALOME session. 

<h2>General Preferences</h2>

\image html pref_salome_general.png

- <b>Language</b>
  - <b>Current language</b> - the language used by the application
  GUI. The language change will come in force only after the application is restarted.
  - <b>Use C locale</b>  - when checked, the C locale will be set for the application,
  otherwise a system locale will be used. The locale change will come in force only after
  the application is restarted.
- <b>Look and feel</b>
  - <b>Show splash screen at start-up</b> - allows showing or hiding the splash screen at start-up.
  - <b>Opaque resize</b> - force opaque resize mode for viewers area (tabbed workspace).
  Clear this checkbox for less perfomant workstations.
  - <b>Drop-down buttons in toolbars for action groups</b> - when
  checked, the action groups are represented in the viewer toolbars as
  a single drop-down button, switchable by the user. Otherwise, all
  the buttons from the action groups are displayed in the toolbar. 
- <b>Study Properties</b>
  - <b>Multi file save</b> - if checked in, your study will be saved in
    several HDF files (one basic HDF file which will store the main
    information about the saved study and several other files for the
    data created by each component used during the study
    session). Opening of this study requires that \b ALL saved files
    should be stored in the \b SAME directory. If you would like to
    copy your saved study in another directory or machine, you should
    copy all stored files. Otherwise, if you try to open this study,
    some data will be lost and it will lead to invalid functioning of
    the SALOME platform. 
  - <b>ASCII save</b> - if checked in, your study will be saved in
    ASCII format file (or files).
  - <b>Automatic loading of light modules when opening study</b> -  if checked in, 
    Light Modules of the current study will be automatically loaded at the next study
    opening, allowing completion of object browser.
  - <b>Store positions of windows</b> -  if checked in, positions of windows
    will be saved in a special file at the end of the current session and
    then restored for a new session.
  - <b>Store positions of toolbars</b> -  if checked in, positions of toolbars
    will be saved in a special file at the end of the current session and
    then restored for a new session.
  - <b>Auto-save interval (min)</b> - allows to specify the time interval (in
    minutes) for automatic study saving operation. If the time interval is
    equal to 0 ("Disabled" value is shown) the automatic saving is not performed.
  - <b>Store/restore last GUI state</b> - if checked in, all GUI settings are
    saved with the rest of the data whenever you save the study. When the
    study is reopened, the GUI state is restored.
  - <b>Publish in study in python dump</b> - if this option is switched on,
    the Python script resulting from Dump Python operation will
    include commands related to the publication of the data in the
    study (if this option is supported by specific module).
  - <b>Multi file python dump</b> - allows to generate multiple files
    (separately for each component) for dumping of a study to a python script.
    If the option is disabled, the study is dumped to a single python script.
  - <b>Save GUI state in python dump</b> - if this option is switched on,
    the Python script resulting from Dump Python operation will
    include commands related to the GUI state.
- <b>External browser</b> - allows to define what browser will 
    be used to show SALOME reference manuals: internal (built-in
    SALOME browser) or external (IE, Netscape, Mozilla, ...). In
    addition, it is possible to specify 
    - \b Application - this option allows you to set an external browser (IE,
    Netscape) which will be used for viewing SALOME reference manuals. By

- <b>Show MRU items</b> - allows to define the maximum \b Number of
items in <b>Most Recently Used</b> list and the <b>Link type</b>: 
  - \b Long - shows the full path to the file. 
  - \b Short - shows the file name only.
  - \b Auto - shows full paths to the files only if some files from
different locations have the same name.
- <b>Full-screen</b> 
  - <b>Hide object browser and viewers toolbars</b> - switches automatic hiding of 
  Object Browser and OCC viewer toolbar in full-screen mode.

    - <b>Recording at a given FPS</b> - records only when the contents
    of the viewer change (some activity is performed).  In the AVI file
    non-recorded images are substituted with the copies of the latest
    recorded image, which produces files with lower quality but requires
    less system resources.
  - <b>FPS</b> - allows to define the FPS (frames per second) rate for
  the clip. Set greater value for better quality.
  - <b>Quality</b> - allows to set the quality of the clip in the
  interval between 0 and 100.

  dialogs only). It means that the object browser will be scrolled to the
  published objects, make them visible if they are collapsed and select the
  first of them. Three modes are allowed for activating this feature:
    - <b>Never</b> - automatic browsing is disabled.
    - <b>After Apply & Close only</b> - browsing is activated when the
    dialog is accepted by <b>Apply & Close</b> or <b>Ok</b> buttons (or if
    the objects are published without using a dialog, for example, by
    clicking a context menu button) and not activated when the
    <b>Apply</b> button is pressed and therefore the dialog remains visible.
    - <b>Always</b> - automatic browsing is always enabled.
- <b>Default columns</b> - these checkboxes allow to display or hide <b>Value</b>,
<b>Entry</b>, <b>IOR</b> and <b>Reference entry</b> columns in the Object Browser.

various operations. To change keyboard sequence for a certain action - select the
action and press the custom keys combination.


\subpage select_color_and_font_page "Font and color preferences"
are most oftenly used types of user settings.

When you change settings (click \b OK or \b Apply button) each module
receives the notification about what preferences are changed. You can
also click \b Defaults button to restore default preferences or \b Close
button to quit the dialog box without any changes. 

\b Import button allows loading specific user file containing
preferences from any location at the computer through a standard
Import dialog box.

\image html import.png

The preferences files usually have *.xml extension. Also,
preferences files automatically saved by the application (stored in the
~/.config/salome directory) have no extension and by default start with
.SalomeApprc. followed by SALOME version number. Usually there is a
separate preferences file for each SALOME version in use. Preferences
are saved to the file in the end of the working session and restored
at the application start-up.

\note The preferences you set will be default preferences for all \b new
objects, but they are not retroactive and do not automatically apply
to the existing objects.
