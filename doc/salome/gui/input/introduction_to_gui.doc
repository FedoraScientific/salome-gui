\n SALOME GUI is based on SUIT (Salome User Interface
Toolkit) that proposes very flexible, powerful and safe mechanisms of
interaction with SALOME tool components (both CORBA and standalone),
resource management, viewers and selection handling,
exception and signals processing. This approach brings to the top
Salome multi-desktop dockable-windowed user interface.
\n All Graphical User Interfaces of standard modules have plug-in
structure, i.e. each module is placed in a dynamic library which is
loaded on demand. So, all modules add their own menu items, buttons
in toolbar, windows etc.
\b GUI (Graphical User Interface) provides a common shell for all
components, which can be integrated into the SALOME platform and some
basic GUI functionalities, common for all modules.

<ul>
<li>\b File menu corresponds to \subpage study_management_page "Study management" functionalities
(creation, saving, loading, editing studies, etc.).</li>
<li>\b Edit menu gives access to <b> Copy/Paste</b> allowing to paste the
objects from one study into the other. The availability of this
functionality depends on the module and the nature of an operation or
an object.</li>
<li>\b View and \b Window menus provide functionalities of 
\subpage salome_desktop_page "Desktop management". Basically, they
allow to show/hide toolbars, activate and manage study windows, change
the appearance of Salome, etc. Among key parts of study window are: 

<ul>
<li>Viewer window, used for visualization of objects,</li>
<li>\subpage using_object_browser_page "Object Browser", used for
management of objects created or imported into the SALOME
application, also providing search possibilities with the 
\subpage using_find_tool_page "Find Tool", and </li>
<li>\subpage using_notebook "Notebook" - allows to predefine study variables.</li>
<li>\subpage python_interpreter_page "Python interpreter", used for
direct input of python commands and dumping studies into Python
scripts. </li> 
<li> Almost all aspects of Salome look and feel can be tuned by the
user in \subpage themes_page "Themes" dialog. </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>\b Tools menu gives access to: \subpage using_catalog_generator_page "Catalogue Generator", 
\subpage using_registry_tool_page "Registry tool" and \ref using_pluginsmanager "Python plugins"</li>
<li>\b Help menu gives access to the help on Salome modules. The
appropriate help page can also be called from any operation dialog via
\b Help button.</li>
</ul>

Help for the GUI module provides information about standard
\subpage viewers_page "Salome Viewers".

General application preferences are described in the \subpage setting_preferences_page "Preferences" 
section of SALOME GUI Help.


\subpage using_input_widgets_page "Using input widgets" sub-section
covers specific aspects of behavior of certain kinds of SALOME GUI
input fields.
