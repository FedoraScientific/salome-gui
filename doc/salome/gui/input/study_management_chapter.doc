Study is a document within GUI, where you can carry out all
operations provided by the SALOME functionality. 
This is a certain abstraction layer between actual
document data (probably, remote data available through CORBA) and data
presentation (in the Object Browser). The study is composed of Data
Object instances, united in a tree-like structure.

All operations with studies are available from the \b File menu.

\b New - creates a new study. The study will be created
with default name \b Study1. It is possible to create
several studies, each accessible from the task bar.
\b Open - allows to open an existing study by browsing for it in a
standard Search File dialog box, choosing the required
*.hdf file and clicking \b Open button.
\b Connect - allows to open an unloaded study.

Select one of the studies, which has been previously
created and unloaded and click \b Ok button.

\note SALOME is a multi-study platform. It means that simultaneously you can
work with several studies. 

\b Close - closes the current study, alternatively it is
possible to click on the cross in the upper right corner of the study window.

\note If the study has not been previously saved, this option will
call the following dialog box with several options:

Here, \b Unload option unloads the current study from the SALOME
Desktop. It can be reloaded in the same working session, but if you quit the SALOME application, all changes
in the unloaded study will be lost.

\b Save - saves the current study. Saving a study you also save its layout, i.e. all positions and sizes
of dockable windows. It means that the difference in settings of the
same windows (for example Python console) is possible between
different modules (the same window can have different size and
position when other module is activated). Also each module can
indicate which common windows are necessary for working, and only they
will be displayed when this module is active.

\note If the study hasn't been previously saved, \b Save will
call the standard Search File dialog box where you can enter the name
for your study and save it.

\b Save \b as - allows to save the current study with a new name. Input  a new name for the study in the standard
Search File dialog box and click \b Save button.

<b>Dump study</b> - allows to Dump a SALOME Study in one or several
Python scripts. The following dialog box allows to browse for the location and
define the name for a Python file.

<b>Publish in study</b> - if checked in, the component objects created by
Python commands will be published in the created Study when the script
is played, otherwise the objects will not be published in the Study.

<li>
<b>Save GUI state</b> - if checked in, the current application layout will be
saved in the Python file.
</li>
</ul>
To confirm your choice click \b Save.

<li>\b Author - allows to change the name of the study author</li>
<li>\b Created - gives the date and time of Study creation</li>
<li>\b Locked - allows to lock the  study for modifications. 
Just click on this field and choose \b Yes item. In this case your study will be locked for any modifications
for all users. Next time you try to edit it, you will see the
following warning message:
\image html lockedstudy.png </li>
<li>\b Modified - allows to see if any modifications have been
introduced into study since its last save. </li>
<li>\b Modifications - allows to  view the list of changes made in the study.
In this dialog box click on the \b Modifications field and scroll it
down. Each record contains the date and time of the
modification and the name of the user, who has introduced it.</li>
</ul>

\b Preferences - allows \ref setting_preferences_page "setting preferences"
 applicable to Salome in general and its modules.

<b>Most recently used</b> - contains a list of recently opened
studies, giving the possibility to fast load the required study.

\b Exit - unlike \b Close, closes not only the current, but all opened
Salome studies.
