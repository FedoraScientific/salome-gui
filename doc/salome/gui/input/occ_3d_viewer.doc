<h2>Operations</h2>

The functionalities of OCC viewer are available via its Viewer
Toolbar. Buttons marked with small downward triangles have extended
functionality which can be accessed by locking on them with left mouse
button.

<b>Dump View</b> - exports an object from the viewer in bmp, png or
jpeg image format.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_style_switch.png

<b>Interaction style switch</b> - allows to switch between standard
and "keyboard free" interaction styles. "Keyboard free" style allows
to process all view transformations without using keyboard (only by
mouse) and perform selection in view by pressing "S" key. By default,
rotation in this mode is performed by left mouse button, panning - by
middle mouse button, zooming - by left and middle mouse buttons
pressed simultaneously.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_zooming_style_switch.png

<b>Zooming style switch</b> - allows to switch between standard
(zooming at the center of the view) and advanced (zooming at the
current cursor position) zooming styles.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_triedre.png

<b>Show/Hide Trihedron</b> - shows or hides coordinate axes.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_fitall.png

<b>Fit all</b> - allows to select a point to be the center of a scene
representing all displayed objects in the visible area.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_fitarea.png

<b>Fit area</b> - resizes the view to place in the visible area only
the contents of a frame drawn with pressed left mouse button.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_zoom.png

<b>Zoom</b> - allows to zoom in and out.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_pan.png

<b>Panning</b> - if the represented objects are greater that the
visible area and you don't wish to use <b>Fit all</b> functionality,
click on this button and you'll be able to drag the scene to see its
remote parts.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_glpan.png

<b>Global panning</b> - represents all displayed objects in the
visible area.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_rotation_point.png

<b>Change rotation point</b> - allows to to choose the point around
which the rotation is performed.

\image html set_rotation_point_dialog1.png

By default the rotation point is located in the Center of the bounding
box of an object.

\image html set_rotation_point_dialog2.png

Unchecking <b>Use Bounding Box Center</b> checkbox allows you to
define the coordinates of the rotation point manually.

- <b>Set to Origin</b> button restores the default rotation point
  coordinates.

- <b>Select Point from View</b> button allows to select the rotation
  point in the 3D Viewer.

<hr>

\image html occ_view_rotate.png

<b>Rotation</b> - allows to rotate the selected object using the
mouse.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_front.png
\image html occ_view_back.png
\image html occ_view_top.png
\image html occ_view_bottom.png
\image html occ_view_left.png
\image html occ_view_right.png

These buttons orientate the scene strictly about coordinate axes:
\b Front, \b Back, \b Top, \b Bottom, \b Left or \b Right side.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_anticlockwise.png

<b>Rotate counterclockwise</b> - rotates view 90 @htmlonly &deg; @endhtmlonly counterclockwise.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_clockwise.png

<b>Rotate clockwise</b> - rotates view 90 @htmlonly &deg; @endhtmlonly clockwise.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_reset.png

<b>Reset</b> - restores the default position (isometric) of objects in
the scene.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_shoot.png

<b>Memorise view</b> - saves the current position of objects in the
scene.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_presets.png

<b>Restore view</b> - restores the saved position of objects in the
scene.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_clone.png

<b>Clone view</b> - opens a new duplicate scene.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_clipping.png

<b>Clipping</b> - allows to create cross-section views (clipping
planes) of geometrical objects.

\image html clipping.png

- <b>Base point</b> - allows to define the coordinates of the base
  point for the clipping plane.

  - <b>Reset</b> - returns the base point to coordinate origin.

- <b>Direction</b> - allows to define the orientation of the
  clipping plane.

  - <b>Invert</b> - allows to select which part of the object will be
    removed and which will remain after clipping.

- <b>Preview</b> - allows to see the results of clipping in the
  viewer.

<hr>

\image html occ_view_scaling.png

<b>Scaling</b> - represents objects deformed (stretched or stuffed)
along the axes of coordinates.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_graduated_axes.png

<b>Graduated axes</b> - allows to define axes parameters and graduate
them.

\image html graduatedaxes2.png

- <b>Axis name</b> - if checked the axis name is displayed in the viewer.

  - <b>Name</b> - allows to redefine the axis name.

  - <b>Font</b> - allows to define the font color of the axis name.

- <b>Labels</b> - if checked the labels are displayed in the viewer.

<hr>

\image html occ_view_ambient.png

<b>Toggle ambient light</b> - toggle "keep only ambient light" flag
on/off.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_minimized.png
\image html occ_view_maximized.png

<b>Minimize/Maximize</b> - these buttons allow switching the current
view area to the minimized / maximized state.
<hr>

\image html occ_view_sync.png

<b>Synchronize view</b> - allows to synchronize 3d view
parameters. This button has two states - checked and
unchecked. Clicking on this button opens a drop-down menu listing the
compatible 3d views. As soon as the user selects any view from the
list, the parameters (view point, position, zoom coefficient, etc.) of
the current view are synchronized with the selected view (static
synchronization).

In addition, when this button is in the "checked" state, the dynamic
synchronization of the views is performed, i.e. any zoom, pan, rotate
or other view operation done in one view is automatically applied to
the other view.

Default background for the viewer is specified via the
\ref occ_preferences "application preferences".

<h2>Polyline selection</h2>

OCC Viewer features a special <b>Polyline Selection</b> mechanism,
which allows selecting an arbitraty part of the graphic area using a
polygon frame (rubber band), instead of the usual selection with a
rectangular frame.

To produce a Polyline Selection, lock the right mouse button and draw
the first side of the polygon, then change the direction by clicking
the left mouse button add draw another side, etc. The whole selection
frame is drawn with the locked right mouse button.

As a result, only the nodes within the frame are selected.
