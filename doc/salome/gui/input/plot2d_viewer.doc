The functionalities of Plot2d viewer are available via its Viewer
Toolbar. Buttons marked with small downward triangles have extended
functionality which can be accessed by locking on them with left mouse
button.

<b>Fit area</b> - resizes the view to place in the visible area only
the contents of a frame drawn with pressed left mouse button.
<hr>

\image html plot2d_zoom.png

<b>Zoom</b> - allows to zoom in and out.
<hr>

\b Panning - if the represented objects are greater that the visible
area and you don't wish to use Fit all functionality, click on this
button and you'll be able to drag the scene to see its remote parts.
<hr>

<b>Global panning</b> - allows to define the center of the scene
presenting all displayed objects in the visible area.
<hr>

\image html plot2d_points.png

<b>Draw Points</b> - switches display mode to \em Points. In
this mode, each curve is displayed as a set of points.
<hr>

\image html plot2d_lines.png

<b>Draw Lines</b> - switches display mode to \em Lines. In this
mode, each curve is represented as a set of plain line segments.
<hr>

\image html plot2d_splines.png

<b>Draw Splines</b> - switches display mode to \em Splines. In
this mode, each curve is represented as a spline.
<hr>

\image html plot2d_lmin_normalization.png

<b>Normalization to global minimum by left Y axis</b> - switches
normalization mode to <b>Left Y Axis: Minimum normalization</b>.
In this mode, all curves are normalized to the global minimum by the left Y axis.

\image html plot2d_lmax_normalization.png

<b>Normalization to global maximum by left Y axis</b> - switches
normalization mode to <b>Left Y Axis: Maximum normalization</b>. 
In this mode, all curves are normalized to the global maximum by the left Y axis.
<hr>

\image html plot2d_rmin_normalization.png

<b>Normalization to global minimum by right Y axis</b> - switches
normalization mode to <b>Right Y Axis: Minimum normalization</b>.
In this mode, all curves are normalized to the global minimum by
the right Y axis.

\image html plot2d_rmax_normalization.png

<b>Normalization to global maximum by right Y axis</b> - switch
normalization mode to <b>Right Y Axis: Maximum normalization</b>.
In this mode, all curves are normalized to the global maximum by
the right Y axis.
<hr>

\image html plot2d_linear.png
\image html plot2d_log.png

These buttons allow to switch horizontal axis scale to the linear or
logarithmic mode.

\note The logarithmic mode of the horizontal
axis scale is allowed only if the minimum value of abscissa component
of displayed points is greater than zero.

<hr>

\image html plot2d_linear_y.png
\image html plot2d_log_y.png

These buttons allow to switch vertical axis scale to the linear or
logarithmic mode.

\note The logarithmic mode of the vertical
axis scale is allowed only if the minimum value of ordinate component
of displayed points is greater than zero.

<hr>

\image html plot2d_legend.png

<b>Show Legend</b> - Shows / hides information about the displayed
objects in a legend.
<hr>

\image html plot2d_settings.png

\b Settings - provides an access to the settings dialog box, that
allows to specify advanced parameters for the Plot 2d Viewer.

\anchor settings
\image html plot2d_view_settings.png

The options are as follows:

- <b>Main title</b> the title of the XY plot. By default, it will
  consist of the names of the tables, on the basis of which the curve
  lines have been constructed.

- <b>Curve type</b> you can select from \em Points, \em Lines or
  \em Spline.

- <b>Show legend</b> here you can define the position of the
  description table on the XY plot (to the \em Left, to the \em Right,
  on \em Top or on \em Bottom).

- <b>Legend font</b> here you can set type, face and color for the
  font of Legend item.

- <b>Marker size</b> - size of the points (markers) forming curve lines.

- <b>Background color</b> of the XY plot.

- <b>Deviation marker</b> allows specifying the properties of the
  marker, which is used for drawing deviations data.

  - <b>Line width</b> line width of the marker.

  - <b>Tick size</b> size of the upper and lower horizontal lines of
    the marker.

  - <b>Color</b> color of the marker.

- <b>Normalization</b> allows selecting the type of
  normalization (\em minimum or/and \em maximum) for the displayed
  presentations of 2d curves in the view.

- <b>Scale mode</b> allows selecting the type of scaling (\em Linear
  or \em Logarithmic) for <b>X (Horizontal)</b> or <b>Y (Vertical)</b>
  axes separately. Note that the \em Logarithmic scale can be used
  only if the minimum value of corresponding component (abscissa or
  ordinate) of all points displayed in the viewer is greater than
  zero.

- <b>Axis ...</b> options group allows specifying additional settings
  for each axis separately:

  - <b>Axis title</b> - an axis title.

  - <b>Grid / Axes marks</b> allows defining the maximum number
    of major and minor scale divisions for a given axis. The real
    number of intervals fits to {1,2,5}*10^N, where N is a natural
    number, and does not exceed the maximum.

- <b>Save settings as default</b> If this check box is marked, all XY
  plots will be displayed with these defined properties. 

<hr>

\anchor analytical_curve
\image html plot2d_analytical_curve.png

<b>Analytical curves</b> - provides an access to the analytical curves
dialog box that allows to add, remove and modify analytical curves
for the Plot 2d Viewer.

\image html analytical_curves_dlg.png

The options are as follows:

- Curve parameters:

  - <b>y(x)=</b> allows specifying a python expression, which is used to
    calculate the coordinates of the curve points, where <b>x</b>
    corresponds to the horizontal range, shown in plot 2D viewer.

  - <b>Nb. itervals</b> allows specifying the number of the curve points.

- Curve properties:

  - <b>Auto assign</b> if checked, the properties 
    (<em>Line type</em>, <em>Line width</em>, <em>Marker type</em> and
    <em>Color</em>) are assigned to curves automatically. To define
    the curve properties manually, uncheck this control.

  - <b>Line type</b> allows to choose curve line type from \em None,
    \em Solid, \em Dash, \em Dot, <em>Dash - Dot</em> and
    <em>Dash - Dot - Dot</em>.

  - <b>Line width</b> allows to specify line width of the curve.

  - <b>Marker type</b> allows to choose curve marker type from
    \em Circle, \em Rectangle, \em Diamond, <em>Rightward Triangle</em>,
    <em>Leftward Triangle</em>, <em>Downward Triangle</em>,
    <em>Upward Triangle</em>, \em Cross and <em>Diagonal Cross</em>).

  - <b>Color</b> allows specifying the curve color.

<hr>

<b>Clone view</b> - opens a new duplicate scene.
<hr>

\image html plot2d_print.png

<b>Print view</b> - prints the current view scene.
