Here you can add new variables, remove and rename existing variables and 
change their values.

If you have modified some variables, which are already used in the current
study, you should click <b>Update Study</b> button to apply your changes
to the study.

\note The dialog will not be validated until at least one of variables in
the table has invalid name or value (marked by red color). Names of
variables should be unique and their values should be numerical (integer or
double) or boolean ("True" / "False").
