\page viewers_page Viewers

SALOME provides a set of viewers for data representation. SALOME GUI
module includes several 2D and 3D viewers, that are used for
different purposes within the platform:

- \subpage occ_3d_viewer_page has been developed on
the basis of Open CASCADE Technology (http://www.opencascade.org).
This is the default viewer for SALOME Geometry module, it provids good
representation of construction and transformation of geometrical objects.

- \subpage vtk_3d_viewer_page has been developed
basing on Kitware Visualization ToolKit library (http://www.vtk.org).
This is the default viewer for SALOME Mesh module, where it is used
for visualization of meshes. It is also used in SALOME Post-Pro module
for all 3D presentations.

- \subpage plot2d_viewer_page has been developed
basing on the open-source Qwt library (http://qwt.sourceforge.net).
It is used, for example, for the representation of 2D plots and graphs
in the SALOME Post-Pro module.

- \subpage gl_2d_viewer_page is a general purpose
OpenGL-based viewer, which can be used for visualization of 2D
scenes. This type of viewer is not currently used in SALOME platform
directly, but can be used in custom modules for 2D visualization purposes.

- \subpage qxscene_2d_viewer_page has been
developed on the basis of Qt QGraphicsView scene. This viewer is used
in SALOME YACS module for visualization of computation schemes.
