The look and feel of the SALOME desktop can be customized by the user
via SALOME style preferences.

<b>SALOME style prefereces</b> dialog box is used for customization of
the look and feel of SALOME style. To open it, select in the Main menu
<b>View -> Theme </b> item.

It is possible to choose a predefined scheme in the list to the left
or to create a custom scheme using the controls to the right.

The dialog box contains two pages.

The first page allows specifying the color palette.
- \b Quick button allows automatic color palette definition basing on
the main color specified by the user.

The second page allows specifying different properties of the theme:

- \b Font group allows to edit the font used in menus, dialog boxes, etc.
- \b Lines group allows to apply dashing to Salome elements.
- <b>Widgets rounding</b> allows to round corners of Salome dialog
boxes and define their parameters.
- \b Handle allows to define parameters of the handle.
- <b>Widget effect</b> allows to apply special effects to Salome
dialog boxes.

If SALOME Theme is not used (<b>Use SALOME Style</b> checkbox is
switched off), the global system settings are applied (for
example, KDE settings). So, the look and feel of the application (for
example, palette and/or font) can be customized by using the Qt utility
<em>qtconfig</em>.
