\page using_object_browser_page Using Object Browser

The <b>Object Browser</b> in SALOME is destined for displaying the
structure of the current study in a tree-like form. It contains:

<ul>
<li>components, loaded during the current session</li>
<li>objects created with the help of different components (The objects
created with the help of a definite component are located in the
folder having the name of this component)
</li>
<li>references to different objects (they are highlighted in red)</li>
</ul>

\note The <b>Object Browser</b> is destined to getting quick access to
different objects created during SALOME session. All pop-up menus
associated with the objects displayed in the Object Browser are
context-sensitive. So it depends on a definite currently loaded SALOME
component what options you will see in the pop-up menu, if you
right-click on a definite object in the Object Browser.

The Object Browser may contain supplementary attributes of the objects
displayed in additional columns. By default, these columns are not
displayed -  displaying/hiding these columns is possible through
\ref setting_preferences_page "setting study preferences" or
right-clicking on the attributes bar and toggling the necessary
attributes.

<ul>
<li>\b Entry  - Identification index of the object in the structure of
the study</li>
<li>\b IOR -  Interoperable Object Reference</li>
<li><b>Reference entry</b>  -  Identification index of the references
to the objects</li>
<li>\b Value  -  Displays the value of the first object attribute</li>
</ul>

\note <b>Entry, IOR and Reference entry</b> attributes are displayed for debugging purposes only.

<h2> Enable sorting </h2>

By default the objects in the object browser are sorted in the creation order. 
\n
However, it is possible to enable sorting 
in the alphabetical order (or the reverse alphabetical order) by right
clicking in the header of the tree (near the "Name" field) and
checking "enable sorting" in the popup menu.
\n
It is possible to use the arrow near "Name" to reverse the order.
If "enable sorting" is unchecked, the objects are sorted in the default order again.
