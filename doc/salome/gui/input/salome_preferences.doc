\image html pref11.png
If you've just started your study and haven't yet loaded other
modules, you'll be able to change only those settings, which refer to
the whole GUI SALOME session. These settings will be valid for the
whole study session.

<h2>General Preferences</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Study Properties</b></li>
<ul>
<li><b>MultiFile Save</b> - if checked in, your study will be saved in
several HDF files (one basic HDF file which will store the main
information about the saved study and several other files for the data created by each component
used during the study session). Opening of this study
requires that \b ALL saved files should be stored in the \b SAME directory.
If you would like to copy your saved study in another directory or
machine, you should copy all stored files. Otherwise, if you try to
open this study, some data will be lost and it will lead to invalid
functioning of the SALOME platform.</li>
<li><b>ASCII Save</b> - if checked in, your study will be saved in
ASCII format file (or files).</li>
<li><b>Store positions of windows</b> -  if checked in, positions of windows
will be saved in a special file at the end of the current session and
then restored for a new session.</li>
<li><b>Store/restore last GUI state</b> - if checked in, all GUI settings are
saved with the rest of the data whenever you save the study. When the
study is reopened, the GUI state is restored.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>External browser</b></li>
<ul>
<li>\b Application - this option allows you to set an external browser (IE,
Netscape) which will be used for viewing SALOME reference manuals. By
default, Mozilla is used. Press the &quot;<b>...</b>&quot; button(see
the picture below) to browse for the application you need in the data
tree of your computer.</li>
<li>\b Parameters</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Python console properties</b> - here you can quickly set the
parameters (style, size, face) of the font used in your Python
console.</li>
<li><b>Show MRU items</b> - allows to define the maximum \b Number of
items in <b>Most Recently Used</b> list and the <b>Link type</b>: 
<ul>
<li>\b Long - shows the full path to the file. </li>
<li>\b Short - shows the file name only. </li>
<li>\b Auto - shows full paths to the files only if some files from
different locations have the same name. </li>
</ul>
</li>  
</ul>
