<h2>Selection</h2>

An element can be selected by clicking on it with the left mouse button.
Selecting objects with locked <b>Shift</b> key produces a multi selection. 

In the viewers there are two selection mechanisms: rectangle and 
polyline selection.

<h3>Rectangle selection</h3>

Rectangle Selection is the basic and commonly used selection tool.
 
To select a rectangle area press and hold the left mouse button while drawing the diagonal of the selection rectangle in the viewer.

\note It is possible to add an area to the existing selection by holding down 
<b>Shift</b> key while selecting.


<h3>Polyline selection</h3>

OCC and VTK Viewers feature a special Polyline Selection mechanism,
which allows selecting an arbitrary part of the graphic area using a
polygon frame (rubber band), instead of the usual selection with a
rectangular frame.

To produce a Polyline Selection, press and hold the right mouse button and draw
the first side of the selection polygon, then change the direction by clicking
the left mouse button add draw another side, etc.

\anchor viewer_navigation_modes
<h2>Navigation modes</h2>

OCC and VTK 3D viewers support two different navigation modes:

- <b>Salome standard controls</b>

  Rectangle selection in this mode is performed by the left mouse button
  and polyline selection by the right mouse button;
  multiple selection is available when \b Shift button is pressed.

  Also, holding \b Ctrl key with pressed mouse buttons performs the following view transformations:
  - \b Ctrl + left mouse button - zooming;
  - \b Ctrl + middle mouse button - panning;
  - \b Ctrl + right mouse button - rotation.

- <b>Keyboard free style</b>

  This mode allows performing all view transformations without using the 
  keyboard (only by the mouse):
  - \b Left mouse button performs view rotation;
  - \b Middle mouse button performs panning; 
  - \b Right mouse button makes zooming.
  .  
  In this style selection of objects in the viewer is performed by pressing
  "S" key or by the left mouse button click. Rectangle selection is done
  by the left mouse button with \b Ctrl key pressed; polyline selection
  is done by the right mouse button with \b Ctrl key pressed.
