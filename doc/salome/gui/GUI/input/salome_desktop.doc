The main SALOME Desktop consists of the following sections and
toolbars:

<b>Basic parts of the SALOME Desktop:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Main menu</b> - This is a set of context-sensitive menus, which will
be updated according the functionality of the loaded component. In
general,  these menus contain all functional options of SALOME
platform.</li>
<li><b>Standard Toolbar</b> - This toolbar contains icons allowing
creating/saving studies, correcting mistakes, copying/pasting
objects.</li>
<li><b>Components Toolbar</b> - This toolbar is destined for uploading
components in SALOME platform.</li>
<li><b>Module Toolbar</b> - This toolbar contains icons specific to the
loaded module.</li>
<li><b>Viewer Toolbar</b> - This is a set of tools destined for visualization
of the presentations in the viewer.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All toolbars in the
\b SALOME Platform are context-sensitive. Loading of a definite component
(Geometry, Post-Pro, Mesh etc.) will automatically add some additional
toolbars specific to this component. To display/hide a definite
toolbar, in the main menu choose <b>View > Toolbars</b>, and from this
submenu check or uncheck the toolbar, you would like to display/hide.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By default all
toolbars are located on the top of the SALOME desktop. But you can
relocate toolbars by dragging with the mouse and dropping it in any
place of the window.

<b>Parts of  the study window:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Object Browser</b> - Management of objects created or imported into
SALOME application.</li>
<li>\b Viewer - This window is destined for visualization of
presentations.</li>
<li><b>Python console</b> - Window for Python interpreter. This window
functions like a standard document: the pop-up menu invoked by
right-click in this window gives access to
<b>Copy/Paste/SelectAll/ClearAll</b> options.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Object Browser, Python
Console, MenuBar, etc are, in fact, separate dockable windows.
Dockable windows can be placed in special areas, on the borders of
desktop like toolbars. You can change the size and the position of
dockable windows, hide them or even place outside desktop. SALOME
saves in the same file all positions and sizes of dockable windows. It
means that the difference in settings of the same windows (for example
Python console) is possible between different modules (the same window
can have different size and position when other module is
activated). Also each module can indicate which common windows are
necessary for working, and only they will be displayed when this
module is active.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting from the
version 3.0.0 Salome uses a <b>Multi-Desktop Approach</b>. Multi-desktop
Approach means that now there is separate Desktop for each document
(Study)  and all windows connected to a Study (viewers, dockable
windows etc) are placed in one container. It is very comfortable,
because you can't mix up windows from different studies. This approach
positively differs from the classic multi document interface in case
if many windows are used, i.e. when one document contains a lot of
viewers, dialogs, etc. Each desktop also has its own menu and toolbar.
