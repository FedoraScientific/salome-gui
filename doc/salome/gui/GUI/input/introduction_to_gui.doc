Since version 3.0.0 SALOME GUI is based on SUIT (Salome User Interface
Toolkit) that proposes very flexible, powerful and safe mechanisms of
interaction with SALOME tool components (both CORBA and standalone),
resources management, viewers and selection handling,
exception/signals processing, bringing to top multi-desktop
dockable-windowed user interface which improves the usability of
SALOME GUI.
\n All Graphical User Interfaces of standard modules have plug-in
structure, i.e. each module is placed in a dynamic library which is
loaded on demand. All modules can create their own menu items, buttons
in toolbar, windows etc
