\page intro_to_salome_page Introduction to SALOME

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
\b SALOME platform represents a generic open source platform for pre-
and post-processing in numeric simulations. \b SALOME combines several
software components, which are built in such a way that it allows to
integrate solvers and existing meshing algorithms along with the
specification of physical properties for a given domain. The
originality of this approach is that the various components must
cooperate dynamically and be 
configurable.

<br>SALOME platform integrates a number of modules each having its own function:
<ul>
<li>\b KERNEL :  provides a common shell for all components, which can be integrated into the SALOME platform.
<li>\b GUI : provides visual representation: basic widgets, viewers
etc. Third party modules optionally can have GUI, but in any case they always connected with KERNEL.
<li>\b Geometry :  facilitates construction and optimization of geometrical models using a wide range of  CAD functions. 
<li>\b Mesh :  generates meshes on geometrical models previously created or imported by the Geometry component.
<li>\b Supervisor :  provides tools for construction of graphs and execution of calculations. 
<li>\b Post-Pro :  performs data visualization.
<li>\b MED :  allows to work with MED files.
</ul>
