In the Post-Pro module you can set preferences, default settings,
which can be used in later sessions with this module.

<h2>MED import Preferences</h2>

\image html ppref1.png

<ul>
<li><b>MED files import</b></li>
<ul>
<li><b>Use Build Progress</b> - when this option is checked you can choose
all other import MED options at the moment of loading of each file
using <b>Build Progress</b> menu, otherwise the loading will be done
according to the <b>Preferences</b> without addressing to the
user.</li>
<li><b>Full MED Loading</b> - when this option is checked, the MED file is
fully loaded in the study, and no additional access to the MED file is
needed during the session. Reversibly, when unchecked, the MED file is
loaded on demand. This is the default behaviour in SALOME and
recommended for big files to optimize memory usage.</li>
<li><b>Build at once</b> - when this option is checked, you can't
perform any operations until the MED file is fully loaded and
processed.</li>
<li><b>Build fields</b> - when this option is checked, the fields are
built automatically at loading.</li>
<li><b>Build min/max</b> - when this option is checked, minimum and
maximum values of the time stamps are found at loading.</li>
<li><b>Build groups</b> - when this option is checked, the groups and
families are built automatically at loading.</li>
<li><b>Close dialog at finish</b> - when this option is checked, the
dialog box is closed after loading of the selected MED file. When
unchecked, it allows loading other MED files.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<br><h2>Scalar Bar Preferences</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>X:</b> abscissa of the point of origin (from the left
side)</li>
<li><b>Y:</b> ordinate of the origin of the bar (from the bottom)</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Scalar bars default position</b></li>
<ul>
<li><b>Arrange Scalar Bars</b> - this option prevents superposition of
scalar bars during visualisation of several fields in the same
window. If checked, a separate scalar bar is displayed for each
presentation.</li>

the study.</li>
<li><b>Generate Curves:</b> If this check box is marked, <b>Post Pro</b>  will
automatically generate curve lines on the basis of values taken from

sprites</b>, <b>Open GL points</b> and <b>Geometrical Spheres</b>.</li>
<li><b>Maximum Size (Clamp)</b> - defines the maximum size of sprite
points ranging from 1 to 512. By default the value is set to 256
pixels.</li>
<li><b>Main Texture</b> -  path to the <b>Main Texture</b> (16x16
pixels) which defines the shape of the point sprite used for
rendering.</li>

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Size</b> - in this menu you can define:</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Range value for min and max size</b> - these two parameters
will be respectively multiplied by a reference length (average size of
cells of the mesh) to define the range for minimum and maximum size of
a point during rendering (at magnification = 100%). Default values
are:</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Rainbow</b> scale: <b>min</b> = <b>10%</b>, <b>max</b> =
<b>33%</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Min size is associated to the smallest real value (including
negative values).</li>
<li>Max size is associated to the largest real value.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Bicolor</b> scale: <b>min</b> = <b>0</b> (not editable),
<b>max</b> = <b>33%</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Null size is associated to the 0 scalar value.</li>
<li>Max size is associated to the largest absolute value.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Both values are dynamically updated by the system according to the
selected scalar bar. In the case of a Bicolor scale, the minimum value
is set to 0 in the dialog and the control is disabled.
<li><b>Magnification (%)</b> corresponds to the change of size of
results at Gauss point primitives in 2D space. Acceptable values range
from 0 to N; 100% means no magnification, 50% means half of its size,
200% mean twice its size and so forth. By default this value is set to
100%.</li>
<li><b>+/- Ratio</b> corresponds to the number by which the
magnification will be respectively multiplied or divided at edition,
ranging from 0.01 to 10. By default this value is set to 2.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Geometry</b></li>
<ul>
<li><b>Size of points (%)</b> defines a value that will be multiplied
by a reference length (representative of the average size of cells of
the mesh) to define the size of points during rendering (at
magnification = 100%). Default values 10%.</li>
<li><b>Color</b> -  allows to select the color of points used for

\image html pref37.png

<ul>
<li><b>Cursor</b> - allows to adjust the Size of the cursor used for
Picking (ranging from 0.1 to 1), the Height of the pyramids (ranging
from 0 to 10) and the Selection cursor color.</li>
<li><b>Tolerance</b> - defines at which distance of the cursor from
the point it becomes selected (ranges from 0.001 to 10).</li>
<li><b>Information window</b> - allows to define the
<b>Transparency</b> (from 0% = opaque to 100% = transparent) and
<b>Position</b> of the window, which can be:</li>

the focal distance at the first selected point (at the end of the
movement of the camera). This value is a ratio that will be multiplied
by the current zoom value.</li>
<li><b>Number of steps between two positions</b> - defines the
smoothness of camera movement at selection by the number of
iterations. If set to 1 the camera is zoomed and centered at the point
momentarily. Greater numbers mean very slow camera movement.</li>

direction with the central mouse button or rotate it with the right
mouse button.</li>
<li><b>Keyboard Free</b> - allows to manipulate objects in the viewer
with the mouse without locking Ctrl button. In this case the
operations are assigned to the buttons differently: rotation is made
with the left button, translation with the right and zoom with both
pressed in the same time.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Keyboard</b></li>

<li><b>Recording at a given FPS</b> - records only when the contents
of the viewer change (some activity is performed).  In the AVI file
non-recorded images are substituted with the copies of the latest
recorded image, which produces files with lower quality but requires
less system resources.   </li>
</ul>
<li><b>FPS</b> - allows to define the FPS (frames per second) rate for
the clip. Set greater value for better quality.</li>
<li><b>Quality</b> - allows to set the quality of the clip in the
