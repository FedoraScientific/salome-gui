In \b SALOME a study can be saved in \b HDF binary (by default) or \b ASCII
files (see also: \ref salome_preferences_page "Setting ASCII save option").

You can also specify  two options of saving your study:
<ul>
<li><b>In one HDF file:</b> in this case all components used during this
study session will write their data into one common HDF file.
</li>
<li>
<b>In multiple files</b> (see also: \ref salome_preferences_page
"Setting Multifile save option") : in this
case SALOME will create one base HDF file which will store the main
information about the saved study and several other special files with
particular extensions storing the data written by each component which
has been used during this study session. Opening of this study
requires that \b ALL saved files should be stored in the \b SAME directory.
If you would like to copy your saved study in another directory or
machine, you should copy all stored files. Otherwise, if you try to
open this study, some data will be lost and it will lead to invalid
functioning of the SALOME platform.
</li>
</ul>

Saving a study you also save its layout, i.e. all positions and sizes
of dockable windows. It means that the difference in settings of the
same windows (for example Python console) is possible between
different modules (the same window can have different size and
position when other module is activated). Also each module can
indicate which common windows are necessary for working, and only they
will be displayed when this module is active.

<em>To save an existing study:</em>
\par
In the main toolbar click "Save document" button or from the main menu
select <b>File > Save</b> option. Your study will be automatically
updated.

\note If your study hasn't been previously saved, this option will
call the standard Search File dialog box where you can enter the name
for your study and save it.

<em>To save a study with a new name:</em>
\par
From the main menu select <b>File > Save as</b> option. In the standard
Search File dialog box enter a new name for your study and click \b Save
button.

<em>To save the current layout of the GUI:</em>
\par
From the main menu select <b>File > Save VISU State</b>. The current
state of the graphic interface is published in Object Browser in the
folder GUI states and can be at any time \b Restored, \b Renamed or \b
Deleted. This operation saves and allows to
restore almost all GUI settings: names, position, zooming and panning
of viewers  and all displayed objects (in Post-Pro module only).

<em>To close a study:</em>
\par
In the main toolbar click "Close document" button or  from the main menu select <b>File > Close</b>
option or click on the cross in the upper right corner of the study
window.

\n\b Unload option allows to unload your current study from the SALOME
Desktop. In the same working session you can  reload it again (see:
\ref opening_studies_page "Opening studies"). But if you quit the SALOME application, all changes
in the unloaded study will be lost.
