Starting from SALOME version 3.0.0. you are able to work in a
multi-desktop environment, which means that you can open as many
studies as you need, place them wherever you wish on the desktop, in
brief, work with Salome Platform like with a normal Windows
application.
\n Such windows as Object Browser and Python Console are dockable and
also can be placed at any part of the desktop.
\n Only one study window in representation area can be active. You can
change their size and move any windows between representation
areas. When an area becomes empty, it is not displayed.
\n All windows are placed inside tabs where you can switch between
them. If there are several windows (viewers) in your current study and
you want to display more then one at the same time, you can split
representation area into two parts, in horizontal or vertical
direction, to create two representation areas with windows be placed
in them. To do this, right-click on the tab and select <b>Split
Vertically</b> or <b>Split Horizontally</b>.

For example, on this screen-shot the active zone has been split
horizontally to be able to work with OCC and VTK viewers
simultaneously, the one of the windows was split again, at this time
vertically to see Plot 2d graphs.
