\page setting_preferences_subpage Setting Preferences

In \b SALOME you can set preferences for each module in the common editor
of preferences. SALOME preferences refer to the whole GUI SALOME
session, other preferences are module-specific and are accessible only
after you load a respective module.
\n When you change settings (click \b OK or \b Apply button) each module
receives the notification about what preferences are changed. You can
also click \b Defaults button to restore default preferences or \b Close
button to quit the menu without any changes. 
\n \b Import button allows to load a user file containing preferences
from your home directory through a standard Import dialog box.

This file has no extension and by default starts with
.SalomeApprc. followed by Salome version number. There exists one file
for each Salome version in use.
\n The preferences, set during the current study session, are
automatically saved in this file at the end of the session. Next time
you launch SALOME application, these preferences will be restored.

\note The preferences you set will be default preferences for all \b new
objects, but they are not retroactive and do not automatically apply
to the existing objects.
